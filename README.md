The "YoutubeVideoDownloader" project includes a .exe file, which installs,
as the name says, Youtube videos of your choice.

This project was made for educational purposes and at the was made by me just for fun.

To get use of this project, simply install the repository, unzip the ZIP file and
execute the "youtube-video-downloader.exe" file.
